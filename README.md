This project includes the following files:

* index.html- which has all of the webpage elements and their class names.
* css folder- containing all of the scss files and the css they are linked to. These files style and manipulate the layout of the elements in the index.html file.
* images folder- containing all of the images I used for the webpage and the favcon.ico image used for the webpage tab.
* main.js- this file contains all of the code used to make the calculator numbers and operators function correctly when pressed and give the correct calculation when the equals is pressed.

Work in progress:

This is a list of things that are a work in progress that are behind the scenes, inside the css, html and js files, that won't be visible on the webpage.
* Restructuring of the main.js file so that the code is neater and easier to navigate.
* Changing any class names that need to be clearer
* breaking out the scss files so that they are easier to read and find elements that have been styled.
